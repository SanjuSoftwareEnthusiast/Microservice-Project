# Microservice-Project
This project is completely microservice architecture , where I have different services, All services are build with one tech stack that is SpringBoot
points to be noted:
1) Here all the services are made individually and are registered as EurekaClient
2) I have implemented Resilience4j circuit breaking mechanism
3) I have made a ServiceRegistery and marked it as EurekaServer

It is basically a rating fetching application, in which we can fetch the ratings of hotels based on User ratings.
I have refer the code from LearnCodeWithDurgesh Channel.
